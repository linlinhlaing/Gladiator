# Project Structure

This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for organizing code and functionality.

## MVC Design Pattern

The MVC design pattern separates an application into three main components:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Presents the data to the user.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

## Validation

Validation ensures that the data entered by the user meets certain criteria or constraints. It helps maintain data integrity and consistency.

## Error Handling

Error handling is crucial for gracefully handling unexpected situations or errors that may occur during the execution of the program.

## Logging

Logging is used to record important events or actions that occur during the execution of the program. It helps in debugging and troubleshooting issues.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of the software to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
